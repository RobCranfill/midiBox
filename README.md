# midiBox

This project is a follow-on to my [miditrans](https://github.com/RobCranfill/miditrans) project. I realized it can almost all be done with Linux utils!

For full details of what I did, see the Wiki here - https://github.com/RobCranfill/midiBox/wiki

## Hardware

### The Music Gear
The music gear I am integrating is
 * Alesis DM6 e-drum kit
 * Alesis SR-16 drum machine
 * Akai MPK Mini MKII mini keyboard/pad

### Additional hardware
* A USB hub, since the RPi only has 2 USB ports, and I need at least three.
